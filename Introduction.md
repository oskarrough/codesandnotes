# THE ROUGH GUIDE TO THE WEB

by Oskar Rough Mosumgaard

Hello World. This is a rough guide and reference for anyone wanting to dive into or learn more about web development. Through trial and error and more hours than I care to think about building websites I now hope to be able to help others.

This guide builds on the work and collective thoughts of the community and there will be just the right references and links you will need.

## So, what do we want?

We need to know how to communicate through digital media, how to design with form and function and how to develop the knowledge into a well made digital product, hopefully with a purpose.

Every single day new techniques, methods and best practices pop up all over and it's important to keep a straight head, understand the technology and more importantly your own goals in order to choose where to invest the one ressource you can't replenish, your time. Choose only what you need and choose the right tool for the right job.
