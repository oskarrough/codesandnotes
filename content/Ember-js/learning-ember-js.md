## ES6 destructuring

const { computed, debug } = Ember;

## Communicating between things

1. Needs

needs: ['post/comments'],
postComments: Ember.computed.alias('controllers.post/comments')

2. Services

todo

3. routeFor/controllerFor/modelFor

## Ember-CLI

An essential part of what makes Ember more productive.

## Addons

One of the great things about Ember is its addon ecosystem through ember-cli. Without it, when you want to add some third-party functionality to your project, you'd need to find, donwload, place, import, reference and activate it first. It's a mess.

If a third-project is written as an ember-addon (basically an ember-cli wrapper around the project), you can do

`$ ember install cool-ember-addon`

â€¦ and you'll have everything ready to go.
