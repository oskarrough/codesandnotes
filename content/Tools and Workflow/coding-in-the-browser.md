- [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/) is my favorite. It's got a really great way of testing and sharing code online. [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net), [CodePen](http://codepen.io), [CSS Deck](http://cssdeck.com) and [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) other examples. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) from Adobe and [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/) as well.
