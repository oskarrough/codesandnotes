Here's how you update [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (the CSS framework written with Sass).

Check which version is currently installed by writing the following in the command line:

`$ compass -v`

It will output the current version like Compass 1.0.0.alpha.17.

Now tell it to install the newest version:

`$ gem install compass`
