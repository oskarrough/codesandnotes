title: A work in progress
---

As of this writing, the <s>4th of May 2014</s> <s>21st of June 2015</s> 26th of December 2016, there is still very much to write and I've learned that this project will never end. Which is a good thing. 

When I started having more time for the project I ended up around threehundred-something articles. And while I appreciate Stalin's remark _"quantity is a quality"_ it does not translate well into the internet. We have an abundance of out-dated articles. One of the ideas of Codes & Notes is to only keep what you really need to know. One way to accomplish this is that I revisit the articles every six months or so. This way you quickly see which, if any, articles here were too specific to a certain era.

If you have any questions, please do [get in touch](mailto:oskar@rough.dk).

## Publishing

I care how you consume which is why I want to publish everything here as a website, as a pdf, as an e-book and of course a hardcover book. Eventually. I take the advice of another good friend: _"ship early, ship often"_.

All this to say that Codes & Notes is a work in progress and it will stay like that. It's best like that.
