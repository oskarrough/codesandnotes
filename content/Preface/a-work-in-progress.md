As of this writing, the 4th of May 2014, there is still very much to write but keeping it away from people until there isn't anymore to write is not the solution. This is why you will find a few poorly-written drafts online.

When I started having more time for the project I ended up around threehundred-something articles. And while I support Stalin's remark _"quantity is also a quality"_ I decided everyone would be better served with more precise and helpful articles. One of the philosophies of Codes & Notes is to only keep what you really need to know.

If you have any ideas, please [let me know](mailto:oskar@rough.dk).

## Publishing

I want to publish everything here as a website, as a pdf, as an e-book and of course a hardcover book. But first I need to nerd out the best possible publishing solution, which could take some time. I take the advice of another good friend: _"ship early, ship often"_.

All this just to say that Codes & Notes is a work in progress and it will stay like that. It's probably best like that.
