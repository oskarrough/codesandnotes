title: A work in progress
---

As of this writing, the <s>4th of May 2014</s> 21st of June 2015, there is still very much to write but I've realized that this project is never going to stop. Keeping it hidden until there isn't anymore to write is not the solution. This is why you will find a few poorly-written drafts online as well.

When I started having more time for the project I ended up around threehundred-something articles. And while I support Stalin's remark _"quantity is a quality"_ I decided everyone would be better served with more precise and helpful articles. One of the philosophies of Codes & Notes is to only keep what you really need to know.

If you have any ideas, please [let me know](mailto:oskar@rough.dk).

## Publishing

I care how you consume which is why I want to publish everything here as a website, as a pdf, as an e-book and of course a hardcover book. Eventually. I take the advice of another good friend: _"ship early, ship often"_.

All this to say that Codes & Notes is a work in progress and it will stay like that. It's best like that.
