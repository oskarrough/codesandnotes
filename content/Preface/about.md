title: About Codes & Notes
---

Hi, I'm [Oskar Rough Mosumgaard](http://oskarrough.com).

This website is a resource on web development. A friend wished for a single place to inspire and guide the vast information overload that is the internet. One place with just the right amount of information, insights and links. See [a work in progress]({{< relref "a-work-in-progress.md" >}}).

If you want some music to listen to while you're reading I'll be the first to recommend a couple of my [own mixes](https://mixcloud.com/oskar) or check [lyde.org](http://lyde.org).

Please read the [Introduction]({{< relref "introduction.md" >}}). If you have any comments, wishes or feedback please get in touch at [oskar@rough.dk](http://mailto:oskar@rough.dk).

## Typography

All titles are set with the beautiful [Eskapade Fraktur](http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade) and everything else is [Edita](http://www.type-together.com/Edita), both by Type Together.

## Setup

I code and note (pun intended) everything on a Mac with Sublime Text. Articles are designed locally in a Gulp setup and compiled with Hugo to build what you're currently looking at. Everything is open source at [github.com/oskarrough/codesandnotes](https://github.com/oskarrough/codesandnotes) - please have a look and let me know if you have any questions.

Previously I've been through Jekyll, Middleman, Wordpress and Drupal but Gulp and Hugo is just perfect for me.
