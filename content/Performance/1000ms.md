title: "Cruising at 60 FPS below 1000ms"
---

Two metrics for a fast and smooth (not janky) experience on the web is to keep your website running (scrolling) at 60fps and avoid tasks longer than one second. When a user performs a task, be it loading a page or deleting some e-mails, you'll want feedback within 1000ms. If the task is any longer, you can use patterns as spinning loaders, help text or finish the task in the background.

- 100 ms: instant
- 100-300 ms: Small perceptible delay
- 300-1000 ms: Machine is working
- 1000+ ms: Likely mental context switch
- 10000+ ms: Task is abandoned
