First and foremost animations should serve a puporse and enhance your story. When we're talking user interfaces - and not animated film - they can be subtle without disturbing. And they should be fast.

## Animating with CSS and JavaScript

Both CSS and JavaScript provide methods to animate elements. You can animate DOM elements directly or you can choose to use Canvas or WebGL.

You can combine the four, you can make use of libraries to speed up the process and hopefully make it easier for you to develop.

As of this writing, animation on the web is still a fairly new topic and there's a lot of catching up to do before we reach the levels of the professional tools already available to game designers or special effects crews.
