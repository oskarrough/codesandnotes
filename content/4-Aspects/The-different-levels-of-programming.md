# The different levels of programming

Like anything else, especially trolls and onions, programming have layers. There are many solutions to the same problems.

While some solutions are better than others, as a beginner it is important to understand that the definition of ‘yes it works’ is very vague when it comes to web development.

## That programming is about solving problems, not writing code.  Here are the four basic tasks that an individual programmer must perform.

	1.	Define the problem (requirements and constraints).
	2.	Define the solution (algorithms and data structures).
	3.	Express the solution in code.
	4.	Prove and/or test correctness.

A lot of people get really good at #3 because it's by far the easiest, but never master the other parts and as a result remain mediocre programmers at best.  Often a good programmer can solve a problem without writing any code at all, by using their knowledge and experience to avoid a problem or find solutions that don't require new code.  In a team, an experienced programmer can often contribute most by helping people with the other non-coding tasks, including a vast array of tasks and skills that don't even come into play for an individual working alone (and were thus left off the list for the sake of brevity).

Once you're proficient in using the tools of your trade, further expertise comes from understanding a particular problem domain other than programming.  It might be something serious like physics or medicine.  It might be something venal like ad targeting or high-frequency training.  It might be something frivolous like games.  You might switch specialties several times during your career.  In any case, being a great programmer means applying the technologies and techniques at hand to some goal other than programming itself.
