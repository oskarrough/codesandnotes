There are tons of designed themes for Wordpress available giving you a quick start which is great! Until it's not.

Starter themes are for when you do know, or want to know, what you're doing.

- [_s (or Underscores)](https://github.com/automattic/_s) is made by Automaticc (the team behind Wordpress) and is very well made and always up to date. There's also a [builder](http://underscores.me/) to get you started.
