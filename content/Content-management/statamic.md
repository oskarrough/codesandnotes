[Statamic](http://statamic.com/) is a pretty useful filed-based CMS system with good ideas for the future. The two major draws for me being total version control and close to no start-up time.

You can store and manage all your content with files (could be text, markdown, html) and Statamic adds variables and templating with PHP and Yaml. I wonder when (if) you hit the wall and wish you went with a more powerful system.
