## The Nature of Code

A DRM-free book about the nature of code by Daniel Shiffman. The entire book is in a github repo and the publishing process is rather interesting.

> "Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This book focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems using Processing."
