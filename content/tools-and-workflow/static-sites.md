title: "Static sites"
---

The UX of text files is very easy to learn. Everybody knows how to edit text and categorize them in folders and this is why building sites using a _static site generator_ can be great.

A server-based CMS require a server (even if it's local), a database and dependencies, and you have to manage the database. It's a hassle.

Static sites are just text but of course there are downsides. There is a reason that all medium to large sites use some form of server-side system and a database.
