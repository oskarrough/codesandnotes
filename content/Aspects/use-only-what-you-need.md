title: Use only what you need
---

Why do it? "Because we can" has become a mantra of our generation. Don't continue it. Don't go nuts with boilerplates, polyfills, shivs, plugins, conditional this and that. The less code you write the less you will have to maintain. And while third-party tools should definitely be used, just consider it for a second or two before you build your product on top of it. Choose only what you need and choose the right tool for the right job.
