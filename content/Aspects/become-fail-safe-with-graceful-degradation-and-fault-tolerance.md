It all works until it doesn't. No matter how experienced we become there is always a chance that it will break, burn and destroy.

Graceful degradation or fault tolerance (different names, same thing) is an aspect that will allow your products to fail without burning down.

It is the flipside to [progressive enhancement]({{< relref "progressive-enhancement.md" >}}). Please see these references:
