title: Package management
---

As you start depending on more third-party packages, plugins and/or components it easily turns into dispair. Which plugin depends on what? In which order do I need to load them? What if there's an update to one that breaks another? Not fun. This is why you could make good use of a package manager.

Package management aims to solve it by "automating the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages".
