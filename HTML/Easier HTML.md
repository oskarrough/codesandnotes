# Easier HTML

Writing HTML can be tedious but luckily you are a developer and developers are lazy, also the ones before you. And we all know who invented the wheel.

## Let your editor do the brackets

Almost every editor helps you with autocomplete. Some editors and their plugins will also help you with abbreviations and fuzzy search.

TL/DR: [Use Sublime Text and Emmet](http://blog.oskarrough.com/2013/02/emmet-and-hayaku/).

## Other languages

HTML can also be abstracted with other languages that will later be converted to HTML. Markdown, jade and HAML are three very popular and common ones but they are very different.
