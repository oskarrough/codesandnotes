Title: Naming conventions

# Naming conventions
Naming conventions help ensure consistency in your code. It helps you remember what is what and it avoids confusion. It makes things easier.
Now, if you're developing alone on a project it will help you a lot but if you're developing on the same project with others you will quickly realize that it is neccesary.

Here are some pointers:

- Pick a system that works for you and your team
- Be consistent
- Think in module, its children and its modifiers
- Find repeatable patterns
- Don't worry about component/module/base confusion. It's different what people choose to call it but in the end it is all the same.


## THE naming convention
This convention is tested, it works and it *will* help you differentiate your classes and allow you to write cleaner, more maintanable code.

```
.namespace-Module-moduleChild--modifier {}
.Module {}
.Module-childName {}
.Module--modifierName {}
.is-stateOfModule {}
.has/.with ???
```
