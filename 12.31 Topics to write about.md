Title: Topics to write about

- layout with divs (and proper naming)
- best practices regarding spans, naming, code hierarchy.
- lists
- what's required for an internship
- different levels of developing

I understand the basics of building a page regarding layout. It's more the small gaps that get me. I spend 30 minutes googling something because an element isn't placed right.
Personally it'd be great to see a few pages created and the decisions behind each component. Ideally that would include some small bits of jquery or php..
And yes, I understand that this might just be a matter of pull up your boots and jump in.
Thanks for the info!
