Sooner or later everyone wish they'd documented their code half a year ago. Generating automatic styleguides from your comments and code in your CSS is pretty magic and serves not only as documentation but ensures consistency in your code _and_ style.

Here are three tools that will do just that:

- [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) (compiles with Ruby - used by Github)
- [Hologram](http://trulia.github.io/hologram/) (compiles with Ruby and is my favorite)
- [Styledocco](http://jacobrask.github.io/styledocco/) (compiles with node.js - write in markdown/html)
- @todo: find a way to generate these on build with Grunt.
