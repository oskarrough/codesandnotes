There are tons of designed themes for Wordpress available giving you a quick start which is great! Until it's not.

Starter themes are for when you know what you're doing or want to know what you're doing. These two I recommend.

*   [_s (or Underscores)](https://github.com/automattic/_s) is made by Automaticc (the team behind Wordpress) and is very well made and always up to date. There's also a [builder](http://underscores.me/) to get you started.
*   [Frank](https://github.com/somerandomdude/frank) is a super fast theme, focused on minimizing database queries etc.
