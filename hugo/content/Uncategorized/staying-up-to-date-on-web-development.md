I gave up following all the feeds I use to and maybe you should too. Newsletters aren't dead, especially not the weekly ones. Gives you freedom! Here are three good ones to subscribe to:

- [Web Design Weekly](http://web-design-weekly.com/)
- [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)
- [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

Much inspired by [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/news) but related to web design:

- [news.layervault.com](https://news.layervault.com)
- [webplatformdaily.org](http://webplatformdaily.org/)
- [sidebar.io](https://sidebar.io)

If algorithms are your thing, [Prismatic](http://getprismatic.com) is a great, great feed. Also, go read [uptodate.frontendrescue.org](http://uptodate.frontendrescue.org/)
