[Compressive Images ' Filament Group](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/rwd_img_compression/).

> Daan Jobsis shared the following premise: when considering a jpeg image's file size, the level of compression makes more of a difference than its physical dimensions. In other words, given two identical images that are displayed at the same size on a website, one can be dramatically smaller than the other in file size if it is both highly compressed and dramatically larger in dimensions than it is displayed.
