Tabs are finding their way into everything these days and these three apps all extend the Finder.app experience with tabs and more.

- [Path Finder 6](http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/)
- [Totalfinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)
- [Xtrafinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/)

Will have to look into the differences.
