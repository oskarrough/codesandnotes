Here's how you can reach productivity Nirvana. Through [Emmet's]("http://emmet.io/") fuzzy, css-like abbreviations you will be able to write your CSS and HTML much more efficiently.

Emmet is a plugin for your text editor that allows to write your HTML and CSS much faster with css-like abbreviations and fuzzy search expansion. Check the playable demo [Emmet documentation]("http://docs.emmet.io/").

[Hayaku](http://hayakubundle.com/) does nearly the same, only just for CSS. If you prefer Hayaku's way of dealing with CSS, you can have them running side by side without problems. I only use Emmet.

And I really recommend devoting an hour's time to learn it. It will pay you back in gazillions. Promise. Most recommended.

## CSS examples

In a CSS file, write `oh`, press `tab` and Emmet will expand it to `overflow: hidden;`. Write `ml1.5r`, press `tab` --> `margin-left: 1.5rem;`

More on [Emmet's CSS abbreviations](http://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations/).

## HTML examples

In a HTML document, write `#Blondie>figure.Logo+ul.Navigation>li*4>a{Item $}` followed by `tab` again and you will get:

`HTML
<div id="Blondie">
    <figure class="Logo"></figure>

- <a href="">Item 1</a>
- <a href="">Item 2</a>
- <a href="">Item 3</a>
- <a href="">Item 4</a>
</div>`

Easy and fast. More on the [HTML syntax in Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/).
