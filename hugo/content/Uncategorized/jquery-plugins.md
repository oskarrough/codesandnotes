Whenever you need a feature, chances are very good that the community already did it. Their solution might be perfect for you, perhaps there are options to configure to your needs. Or perhaps you can contribute and make the plugin better.

Here are two good collections of jQuery plugins:

- [jQuery Plugin Registry](http://plugins.jquery.com/)
- [unheap.com](http://www.unheap.com/)
