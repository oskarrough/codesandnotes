[CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) is an extremely useful tool for front-end developing, making your work with preprocessors so much easier through a GUI.

> CodeKit automatically compiles Less, Sass, Stylus, CoffeeScript & Haml files. It effortlessly combines, minifies and error-checks Javascript. It supports Compass. It even optimizes jpeg & png images, auto-reloads your browser and lets you use the same files across many projects.

## CodeKit + FTP

Now, this works fine and dandy locally but how would you hook it up when you're working live and/or online? You use a tool to mount your FTP server as a local drive.

[Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) (especially version 4 with the disk feature) works wonders for this.
