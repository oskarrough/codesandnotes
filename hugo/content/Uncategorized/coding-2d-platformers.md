I always wanted to create my own 2D platform game. Here I'll collect some things to get started.

*   [Guide to implementing 2D platformers](http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/).
*   [FUTILE 2D](http://struct.ca/futile/) is a code-centric 2D framework for [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) by Matt Rix who, by the way, has been making some impressive games for Ludum Dare.
