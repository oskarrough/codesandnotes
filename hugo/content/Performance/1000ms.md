title: "Stay below 1000ms"
---

When a user performs a task, be it loading a page or deleting some e-mails, try to stay below 1000ms. If the task takes longer, try to hide it visually and let the user continue with other tasks while the first finishes.

100 ms: instant
100-300 ms: Small perceptible delay
300-1000 ms: Machine is working
1000+ ms: Likely mental context switch
10000+ ms: Task is abandoned
