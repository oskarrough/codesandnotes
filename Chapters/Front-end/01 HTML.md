# HTML

The backbone of every website. HTML is a [markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), which basically means you'll be describing, or marking, your content so it can be presented better.

Here's an example:

I'm a title
and I'm the body text.

Which one is which?

«««‘‘‘}}|?>:"|{}”’Æ»<!--  -->˘<h1>I'm a title</h1>
<p>and I'm the body text.</p>

Now it makes sense, not only to computers, but to you and the people using your site.
