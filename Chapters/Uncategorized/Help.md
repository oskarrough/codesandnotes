You're stuck so where to go? First, Google it and Google it again using Google.com - not your local Google. Next, ask your friends. If you're the first with this problem, I'd be amazed. Lastly, try one of these sites:

- [http://stackoverflow.com](remember the network e.g. ux, drupal etc)
- IRC (freenode)
- [Quora](http://quora.com)
- [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)
