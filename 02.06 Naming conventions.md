Title: Naming conventions

# Naming conventions
- Pick a system that works for you and your team
- Be consistent
- Think in module, its children and its modifiers
- Find repeatable patterns
- Don't worry about component/module/base confusion. It's different what people choose to call it but in the end it is all the same.


## THE naming convention
This convention is tested, it works and it *will* help you differentiate your classes and allow you to write cleaner, more maintanable code.

```
.namespace-Module-moduleChild--modifier {}
.Module {}
.Module-childName {}
.Module--modifierName {}
.is-stateOfModule {}
.is-stateOfModule {}
```
