# DEVELOPING FOR THE WEB
by Oskar Roug(h) Mosumgaard

## Hello World
This is a ongoing reference for everyone, including myself. It's a guide for people who want to learn more or dive into development for the web. Through trial and error and a lot of time I've come to know things about making websites that I hope could help others.

The guide builds on the work and thoughts of the community and as such does not try to reinvent the wheel but rather function as a starter- and reference guide to working with website.

## So what do we need?
We need to know how to communicate with digital media, how to design it with form and function and how to develop everything into a well made digital thing, hopefully with a purpose. And we need to have the right tools for the right job.

Every single day new techniques, methods and best practices pop up all over the internet and it's important to keep a straight head, understand the technology and your own goals in order to choose where to invest your time. Choose only what you need.
