# THE ROUGH GUIDE TO THE WEB
by Oskar Rough Mosumgaard

Hello World. It is a rough guide for anyone wanting to dive into or learn more about web development. Through trial and error and more hours than I care to think about I've learned a thing or two about making websites that I hope could help others build better products.

This guide builds on the work and collective thoughts of the community and as such there will be many references and links for further information.

## So, what do we want?
We need to know how to communicate with digital media, how to design with form and function and how to develop everything into a well made digital product, hopefully with a purpose. For this we also need to have the right tools for the right job.

Every single day new techniques, methods and best practices pop up all over and it's important to keep a straight head, understand the technology and your own goals in order to choose where to invest the one ressource you can't replenish, your time. Choose only what you need.
