# HTML

The backbone of every website. HTML is a [markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), which basically means you'll be describing, or marking, your content so it can be presented better. Every HTML document (or websites, same same but different) is a piece of information or content. Without HTML, it is just text. With HTML, the browser and you have access to the way the author thought to markup that content. Let me give you an example:

--
This is my title
And this is some body text with a link to http://codesandnotes.com.
--

Here the computer has no way of dividing the content into meaningful parts. This is one of HTML's jobs. It would look like this:

--
<h1>This is my title</h1>
<p>And this is some body text with a link to <a href="http://codesandnotes.com">Codes &amp; Notes</a>.</p>
--

Now it makes sense, not only to computers, but to you and the people using your site because browsers will apply default styling and functionality to the elements, not that it recognizes them. HTML is elements which consist of tags, attributes and content. To avoid any confusion please read <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200508/html_tags_vs_elements_vs_attributes/">HTML tags vs. elements vs. attributes</a> now.

HTML are the building blocks. They provide semantics for your content and act as hooks for your <a href="/css">CSS</a> and <a href="/javascript">JavaScript</a> to enhance them with styles and interactivity, respectively.

## Where does HTML come from?

The vocabulary and syntax of HTML are defined in specifications (specs) by a the W3C and the WHATWG, two open groups that discuss, maintains and develops the HTML standard closely together. You can go to their websites to read the specs, the real nitty gritty of how everything works.
