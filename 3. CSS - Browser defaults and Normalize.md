# Browser defaults, Normalize and why you would want it
All browsers come with predefined CSS rules that styles the default elements.
For instance, the `<h1>` element often has the following rules:

`h1 { display: block; font-size: 2; font-weight: bold; }`

These things are often taken for granted (and should be). Without it, every element would lose it's visual meaning.

However, all these defaults are only really useful to a certain point since all designs are different.

Another problem with the default browser styles is that every browser vendor is not using the same ones. Let me give you an example from [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/):

`/* Address style set to `bolder` in Firefox 4+, Safari 5, and Chrome. */
b,
strong {
	font-weight: bold;
}`

Apparently using `b` or `strong` isn't just `bold` it can also be `bolder`. Things is, you never really know and this is why Normalize.css is a great starting point for your projects.

## Introducing Normalize.css
Normalize.css is a relatively small .css file you can include at the start of your projects to close the gaps between browser defaults so you won't have to think about it yourself. 

> Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

> Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. Itâ€™s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
