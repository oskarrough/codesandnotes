# Perceived performance

Performance is one thing, perceived performance is another. Using different techniques it's very possible to make things feel faster than reality. But what if perception is reality?

Consider the following: you want to copy a file from A to B and do it using two different applications.

Both apps take the same 10 seconds to finish the task but there's one huge (perceived) difference of performance. Both apps pop up a dialog with the status but the second app closes the dialog at 90%, not 100%. Wait, what? But then it makes you think the task is done before it is.

YES.

And that's perceived performance for you right there.

Perceived performance will make your software feel faster, which in turn will make it faster.
