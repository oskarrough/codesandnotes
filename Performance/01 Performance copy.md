# Performance
If there's one thing you can do to improve user-experience on a site, it isn't optimising your media queries for different devices or making images fade smoother. It is making it fast. Speed is more important than aesthetics.

Here are some general tips but be sure to read through the references including the speed developer tools provided by Google and Yahoo.

Tip from Captain Obvious: Don't use stuff you don't need.

## HTTP Requests
Reduce HTTP requests to an absolute minimum. Concatenate files. Use parallels requests.

## Image optimisation
use png-8 whenever possible
