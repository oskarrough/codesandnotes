# Sublime Text
Sublime Text (as of writing version 3.0) is my editor of choice. It's insanely fast, extendable through packages, runs on every platform and has a huge community. In short, it's everything you need.

Subl

Sublime text has nice mate-esque command line launcher called 'subl' hidden in its distribution. To make it available universally:

`$ ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl`
Once Installed, you can run it anywhere to open a fresh project/window:

`$ subl .`
