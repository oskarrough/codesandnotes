# Package management and Bower

The problem
As you start depending on more third-party packages/plugins/components it can easily turn in to dispair. Which plugin depends on what? In which order do I need to load them? What if there's an update to one that breaks another? Not fun.

The solution
Package management tries to solve this by “automating the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages”.

How?

## Bower
