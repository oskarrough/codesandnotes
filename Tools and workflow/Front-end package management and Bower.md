# Package management and Bower

As you start depending on more third-party packages/plugins/components it will be hard mantaining them. Front-end package management is a pain. You have to remember where to download them, you have to take care of using the right version. Oh, and does this version work with that version of this?

Package management solves all this by “automating the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages”.

How?
