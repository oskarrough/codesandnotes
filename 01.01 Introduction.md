Title: The rough guide to the web

# THE ROUGH GUIDE TO THE WEB by Oskar Rough Mosumgaard

Hello World. This is a ongoing reference for everyone, including myself. It's a rough guide for people who want to learn more or dive into development for the web. Through trial and error and trial and error and more hours than I would like to think about, I've come to know things about making websites that I hope could help others build better products in less time.

This guide builds on the work and thoughts of the community and as such does not try to reinvent the wheel but rather work as a starter- and reference guide.

## So what do we need?
We need to know how to communicate with digital media, how to design it with form and function and how to develop everything into a well made digital product, hopefully with a purpose. And we need to have the right tools for the right job.

Every single day new techniques, methods and best practices pop up all over the internet and it's important to keep a straight head, understand the technology and your own goals in order to choose where to invest your time. Choose only what you need.
