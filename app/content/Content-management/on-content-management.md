What are you doing right now? Whether you are supposed to be developing, designing or thinking about something, what it probably boils down to is communicating some information. Some content. Without the content all you have is nothing.

> Let’s be really clear about this. It is unrealistic to write your content – or ask your client to write the content – before you design it. Most of the time. Content needs to be structured and structuring alters your content, designing alters content. It’s not ‘content then design’, or ‘content or design’. It’s ‘content and design’.

Now, back in the days everything was hardcoded without databases. No, not really. What do I know.

**@todo**
