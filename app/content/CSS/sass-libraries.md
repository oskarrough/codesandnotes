[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/) are two highly useful mixin library for Sass. Personally I find Compass and the entire (big) community behind it more appealing. If you feel like contributing, [it's all open](http://compass-style.org/get-involved/).
