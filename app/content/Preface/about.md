Hi, I'm [Oskar Rough Mosumgaard](http://oskarrough.com).

This website is a resource on web development. A friend wished for a single place to inspire and guide the vast information overload that is the internet. One place with just the right amount of information, insights and links. See [a work in progress](http://codesandnotes.com/a-work-in-progress/).

If you want some music to listen to while you're reading I'll be the first to recommend a couple of my [own mixes](https://mixcloud.com/oskar) or check [lyde.org](http://lyde.org).

Please read the [Introduction](http://codesandnotes.com/introduction/). If you have any comments, wishes or feedback please get in touch at [oskar@rough.dk](http://mailto:oskar@rough.dk).

## Typography

All titles are set with the beautiful [Eskapade Fraktur](http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade) and everything else is [Edita](http://www.type-together.com/Edita), both by Type Together.

## Setup

I write on my Mac in Sublime Text or directly in Wordpress. Articles are designed locally in a Gulp setup and when they're ready I copy/paste them into Wordpress where they are also categorized and set into order. I've open sourced everything at [github.com/oskarrough/codesandnotes](https://github.com/oskarrough/codesandnotes) - please have a look and let me know if you have any questions.

I've also been using Middleman and Jekyll for publishing but I'm not yet sure that the benefits of static publishing outweigh the dynamic ones of a CMS like Wordpress.
