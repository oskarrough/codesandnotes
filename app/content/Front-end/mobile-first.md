title: Mobile first
---

The web is mobile. Ignore at your own peril.

There are more people using the internet with a mobile device than a desktop device, so why are you still creating whatever you are creating with a desktop first approach?

Instead, design and think your app from a mobile first perspective. A mobile device has a much smaller screen, slower processor and other input methods. These constraints and differences offer you with an opportunity to focus and simplify the concept of your idea.
