So, you are stuckâ€¦ What do you do? First, Google it and Google it again. If you're using Google in another language than English I suggest switching to see more results.

Next, ask your friends. If you're the first with this problem, I'd be amazed.

And if everything else fails, you can try:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Quora](http://quora.com)
- IRC (freenode)
- [Github](https://github.com) - find the project you're using and check their (closed) issues.
