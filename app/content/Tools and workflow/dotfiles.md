What are dotfiles, why do I need them and what does it have to do with Github? [Read on](http://dotfiles.github.com/). Essentially, a bunch of scripts for OSX that make it easier to maintain a proper development environment.

[My dotfiles](https://github.com/oskarrough/dotfiles) are based on [those of @necolas](https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles).
