Here are some tips to make you more productive with HTML by optimizing your efficiency and speed. Writing HTML can be tedious but luckily you are a developer and developers are all lazy. Fact. And we all know who invented the wheel.

## Let your editor do the brackets

Almost every editor can help you with autocomplete. Try to write the first few characters of a word and then press the key to expand the suggestion. In my Sublime Text that key is the tab key. Could also be enter.

For instance, writing "a" followed by a press on tab, my editor writes `<a href=""></a>`. Much faster than typing all those special characters by yourself over and over again. To take it even further Emmet is a great plugin that will do much more. [Write faster HTML and CSS with Emmet](/write-faster-html-css-with-emmet/).

If you have an open tag and want close it, e.g. write `</a>` you can do so by pressing `alt+command+` in Sublime Text.

## Other ways of writing HTML

By design HTML is simple in its syntax. [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and <a href="http://haml.info/"">HAML</a> are two ways of adding more features to your markup writing.

@todo: write about web components and html imports
