# Object-orientated JavaScript

Object-oriented programming is a way of programming that is extremely useful and widely used in almost every programming language.

	Object-oriented programming is intended to promote greater flexibility and maintainability in programming… By virtue of its strong emphasis on modularity, object oriented code is intended to be simpler to develop and easier to understand later on…

	Object-oriented programming may be seen as the design of software using a collection of cooperating objects, as opposed to a traditional view in which a program may be seen as a collection of functions…

You have to know about object-orientated programming in general and you have to learn about the JavaScript version of it and how to make use of it.

Read [Object-orientated JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript]) on the MDN.

## The rough explanation

When coding some JavaScript most beginners start out just declaring one function after another with variables scattered all over the place. This might very well for some time but as things get more advanced or you need to implement a new feature, things will get too complicated and things start to break.

	You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
	Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
	You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
	Who's down with OPP (All the homies)

Ok.

Instead of having all these functions one after another, you will break your app, wait. People use the word 'app' for everything. In this case I just mean your code, whatever it used for.

You identify your code, split it into several functions that can call each other.
