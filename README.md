# README and preface

This is a collection of my thoughts and writings on creating things (websites) on the internet. Inspired by a good friend curious to learn more about development for the web, the plan is to touch and guide on all topics I would recommend him to invest time in.

Now, I want to publish them somehow but first I *need** to nerd the best possible publishing solution. Since this could take a lifetime I take my other good friend's advice and ship early, ship often.

Please see Introduction.md.
