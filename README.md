# Codes & Notes

This is the repository of the book on web development I’m writing.  It is called [Codes & Notes](http://codesandnotes.com)

Also read the [Introduction](http://codesandnotes.com/introduction)

## Technical setup

First I wrote all articles in Dropbox, categorized in folders and markdown files. This is great but it gives me more control to have everything in a CMS like Wordpress. This way I don’t have to update table of contents, chapters and topic pages manually.

The articles in this repository are the ones not yet finishes or moved to the Wordpress install.
