# Codes & Notes

This is the repository of the book on web development Iâ€™m writing.

Please read the [Introduction to Codes & Notes](http://codesandnotes.com/introduction).

This repository contains only drafts (as well as some setup). Everything ready for the public is on the website, not here.

## Technical setup

Currently running on a custom Wordpress install. Todo: move back to a static site system.
